A Cinema Reservation System Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
In this project, I created a cinema reservation system using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The system allows users to select seats for a movie. If a seat has already been reserved, it will be displayed in white. Unreserved seats will be displayed in light shades of black. Selected seats will be displayed in yellow. The system also calculates the total cost of the reservation based on the seat type and the film category.
Details
The system uses a simple algorithm to determine whether a seat is available. The algorithm checks to see if the seat is already in the reservation database. If the seat is not in the database, it is considered to be available.
The system calculates the total cost of the reservation based on the seat type and the film category. The seat type is determined by the row and column of the seat. The film category is determined by the film's rating.
Additional Features
The ability to book multiple seats at once
The ability to save a reservation for later
The ability to print a ticket
These features would make the system more user-friendly and would provide additional functionality for users.
